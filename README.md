# MovieTime
In this demo app I created a movie database application on Swift with Storyboard.

## App Contains:
1. Main Screen with popular movies (Horizontal Collection View)
2. Main Screen with 3 different movie lists (Table View)
3. Search Screen with all results (Movie,Person,TV Show)

## In this demo app I used and practiced:
1. UITabBar, UINavigationBar
2. APICaller, DispatchQueue, URLSession
3. CollectionView, TableView
4. UIKit and Storyboard

## Currently Working on
1. Details Screen for movies and other
2. Profile System with Firebase
3. Custom Status Bar color
4. Bug fixing (color change on tabbar and navbar)
