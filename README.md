# MovieTime
In this demo app I created a movie database application on Swift with Storyboard.

## App Contains:
1. Main Screen with popular movies (Horizontal Collection View)
2. Main Screen with 3 different movie lists (Table View)
3. Search Screen with all results (Movie,Person,TV Show)
4. Detail Screen for content
5. Cast, Crew and Seasons List on Detail Screen
6. Clickable TableView for Lists to present desired person,production details in new ViewController
7. Custom Status Bar
8. Non-functional login page

## In this demo app I used and practiced:
1. UITabBar, UINavigationBar, UISearchBar
2. APICaller, DispatchQueue, URLSession, Concurrency
3. CollectionView, TableView
4. UIKit and Storyboard
5. Shadows, Layers, Borders

## Currently Working on
1. Profile System with Firebase and Like, Review, Follow features
2. Bug fixing
3. MVVM Structure Implementation
