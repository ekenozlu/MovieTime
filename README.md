# MovieTime
In this demo app I created a movie database application on Swift with Storyboard.

## App Contains:
1. Main Screen with popular movies (Horizontal Collection View)
2. Main Screen with 3 different movie lists (Table View)
3. Search Screen with all results (Movie,Person,TV Show)
4. Detail Screen for content (currently fixing bugs)

## In this demo app I used and practiced:
1. UITabBar, UINavigationBar
2. APICaller, DispatchQueue, URLSession
3. CollectionView, TableView
4. UIKit and Storyboard

## Currently Working on
1. Profile System with Firebase and Like, Review, Follow features
2. Custom Status Bar color
3. Bug fixing (color change on tabbar and navbar)
4. MVVM Structure Implementation
